      Projects can be rearranged by clicking the "edit" button on the left and dragging entries up and down. The entry at the bottom (newest added) will appear at the top of the homepage. (The list gets reversed: whatever is #1 on the list here will appear last on the homepage, or visa versa.)

      Make sure that the page is set to "visible". If you click into the project page, there is a toggle in the sidebar which will show whether the page is visible or invisible. You can also manage visiblility using the "edit" button on the left and dragging projects between the two columns.
