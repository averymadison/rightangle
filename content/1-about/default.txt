John Decker has been woodworking for most of his life. His first large-scale project, built from wood at the age of 13, was a small race boat. He successfully raced that boat for many years.

John spent the next 25 years involved in the marine industry. During that time, he honed his engineering, design, and management skills while working at Wellcraft and Marine Concepts.

In his off hours, John continued to develop his woodworking craft. He left the marine industry in 2003 to devote his full attention to woodworking. Today his customers receive the benefits of his varied background. His products are created and engineered for maximum comfort, durability, and style.
