Title: About

----

Background: 

**My name is John Decker.** I have been woodworking for most of my life. My first big project was a small wooden race boat, which I built when I was thirteen. I raced that boat successfully for many years.

I spent the next 25 years in the marine industry. During that time, I honed my engineering, design, and management skills while working at (link: http://www.wellcraft.com/ text: Wellcraft) and (link: http://www.marineconcepts.com/ text: Marine Concepts).

On nights and weekends, I continued to woodwork, and in 2003 I left Marine Concepts to devote my full attention to my craft. Our family relocated from Florida to North Carolina, and I've been making furniture here ever since.

Beliefs: 

My background prepared me to execute complex projects on time and on budget. I believe in doing things well, and take pride in creating furniture that is comfortable, durable, and stylish.

I construct all of my furniture from non-endangered wood where natural reforestation outpaces harvesting.
