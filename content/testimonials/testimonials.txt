    When John is doing work for us, we can
    give him full access to the house while
    we vacation many miles away. There are
    so many great things that we can say
    about John and his work—however, the
    nicest part is always knowing that when
    John is doing a job, we don’t have to
    worry about the process or the results.
    We know that we are going to be happy.

    I can’t say enough good things about
    their workmanship with attention to
    details. I would highly recommend John.
    It’s worth waiting as the job gets
    done right.

  quote: 'It is always a pleasure having John do work for us. We have used some other contractors who did a great job, but not the way John does a great job. John is our favorite because he goes beyond what is required: he fixes things that he finds that are broken and often cleans up others’ messes.'

    I really love the kitchen and thank you
    so much for doing such a wonderful
    job—from the planning and selection to
    the actual execution. I could not have
    wished for a better process.

    Two years ago, John began the renovation
    on our 100 year old cabin in Chimney
    Rock. The quality of his work,
    craftsmanship and design ideas for small
    spaces far exceeded our wildest dreams.
    His knowledge and use of various types
    of wood was used throughout the cabin
    and every detail is perfect. We love his
    work so much, he is now doing our dream
    home in Hendersonville.

Recently he did remodel of our family room that included new oak paneling and trim that he designed and built. From planning to completion John's attention to detail along with a very high level of craftsmanship makes working with him a breeze."

They were always prompt, efficient and hardworking. They cleaned up nightly, so I wasn't living in a mess. I am extremely pleased with everything. No surprises—just high quality work!"

    John remodeled two different homes for
    me and I could not be happier with the
    jobs he has done. He listened to my
    needs and desires and came up with plans
    that were exactly what I had in mind. He
    is very conscientious with the quality
    of his work, easy to be around and
    extremely neat. A joy to work with.

  quote: "I am always sad when John isn't working on something for me, because when he *is* working for me I know I'll have something precise and beautiful to see in the near future. Whatever it is, it will be ready on time and on budget, a rarity these days. We have even had John do a major remodeling in the Keys while we were in Asheville, and a major remodeling in Asheville while we were in the Keys. He is the only man I would fully entrust my homes to in such a manner."
