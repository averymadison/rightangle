  quote: "When John is doing work for us, we can give him full access to the house while we vacation many miles away. There are so many great things that we can say about John and his work—however, the nicest part is always knowing that when John is doing a job, we don't have to worry about the process or the results. We know that we are going to be happy."

    I can’t say enough good things about
    their workmanship with attention to
    details. I would highly recommend John.
    It’s worth waiting as the job gets
    done right.

  quote: "It is always a pleasure having John do work for us. We have used some other contractors who did a great job, but not the way John does a great job. John is our favorite because he goes beyond what is required: he fixes things that he finds that are broken and often cleans up others' messes."

    I really love the kitchen and thank you
    so much for doing such a wonderful
    job—from the planning and selection to
    the actual execution. I could not have
    wished for a better process.

    Two years ago, John began the renovation
    on our 100 year old cabin in Chimney
    Rock. The quality of his work,
    craftsmanship and design ideas for small
    spaces far exceeded our wildest dreams.
    His knowledge and use of various types
    of wood was used throughout the cabin
    and every detail is perfect. We love his
    work so much, he is now doing our dream
    home in Hendersonville.

  quote: "John Decker has done both large and small projects for us. He rebuilt our deck which was included the difficult task of stabilizing it on a steep slope. Recently he did remodel of our family room that included new oak paneling and trim that he designed and built. From planning to completion John's attention to detail along with a very high level of craftsmanship makes working with him a breeze."
